   ```shell
   cd react-todo-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install

## Redux Toolkit

This application uses [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) to manage the state. Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of working with Redux by providing utility functions to create reducers, actions, and configure the Redux store.

## Folder Structure

- `src/components`: Contains React components.
- `src/features/todo`: Contains Redux reducers.
- `src/store`: Defines the Redux store configuration.
- `src/App.js`: The main application component.
- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the application.
